			<p>
			    <strong>1. </strong>
			    <strong><u>Terms and Conditions</u></strong>
			</p>
			<p>
			    Before using the CRI Genetics Website (“Website”), ordering a DNA Sample
			    Collection Kit (“DNA Sample Kit”) or having access to the results of your
			    DNA Sample Kit (“DNA Results”), you must review and accept these terms and
			    conditions (the "Terms and Conditions" or "Agreement"). The Agreement
			    defines your rights and responsibilities as a user ("User", sometimes
			    referred to as “you” as permitted by context) of the Website and/or the
			    services offered by CRI Genetics (“DNA Service”) (collectively with the
			    Website, the “CRI Services”). By using the CRI Services, you become legally
			    bound by this Agreement, which is between you and CRI Genetics, LLC ("CRI
			    Genetics," "we," or "us"). Do not use the CRI Services if you do not agree
			    to these Terms and Conditions. The right to use the CRI Services is for
			    your sole, personal use, and cannot be transferred to any other person or
			    entity. The CRI Services are operated and provided solely in the United
			    States of America. The DNA Services will not be provided to a User mailing
			    address outside of the United States of America. The CRI Services are
			    governed by this Agreement, which, in turn, is governed by the laws of the
			    State of California and the United States. Registering as a User and having
			    DNA tested as a part of the DNA Service results in your personal and
			    genetic information being stored and processed in the United States, and
			    you specifically consent to CRI Genetics 's storage and processing of the
			    DNA and other personal data you submit. Please note that in order to use
			    the DNA Service, you will need to create an account (“User Account”) hosted
			    on the Website. Your use of the User Account and Website is subject to the
			    CRI Genetics Privacy Statement.
			</p>
			<p>
			    The CRI Services provided herein are intended for persons eighteen (18)
			    years of age or older (“adult”). If you are not an adult, you may not use
			    the CRI Services and you may not accept these Terms and Conditions. If any
			    person younger than 18 years of age (“minor”) gains access to the Website
			    or DNA Service, the parent or guardian of that minor will be held
			    responsible for the minor's actions. If you submit a sample DNA as part of
			    the DNA Service (“DNA Sample”) of a minor, you must represent that you are
			    the minor's parent, legal guardian and/or have explicit permission from the
			    minor's parent or legal guardian. For the avoidance of doubt, if your use
			    of the CRI Services is limited to solely creating a User Account without
			    submitting a DNA Sample or providing any other information regarding your
			    DNA (“DNA Information”), you must be at least thirteen (13) years of age or
			    older to accept these Terms and Conditions.
			</p>
			<p>
			    These Terms and Conditions, together with the CRI Genetics Privacy
			    Statement and Consent Agreement, and any other legal notices, terms,
			    guidelines, or rules applicable to the CRI Services published by CRI
			    Genetics on the Website from time to time, shall constitute the entire
			    agreement between you and CRI Genetics concerning the CRI Services. All
			    such notices, terms, guidelines or rules are hereby incorporated by
			    reference into this Agreement. We are not obligated to give you any notice
			    or warning of such modifications taking effect. If you do not wish to be
			    bound by the modified Agreement, you may cancel the agreement by sending us
			    notice of termination to the e-mail address identified in Paragraph 5
			    (Termination) below. Unless and until we receive such notice, your
			    continued access or use of CRI Services following posting of the modified
			    agreement shall be deemed your acceptance thereof. CRI Genetics shall also
			    have the right at any time to change or discontinue any aspect or feature
			    of CRI Services including, but not limited to, all of its content, and its
			    hours of availability. CRI Genetics may also offer other services from time
			    to time that are governed by different terms and conditions.

			    privacy and intellectual property rights). You shall always provide valid,
			    true, accurate, and complete contact information, and you shall always have
			    a valid email address on file with CRI Genetics. Without limitation, you
			    shall refrain from posting, transmitting, sending or otherwise making

			    computer virus or other malicious or harmful code; (v) any content that
			    violates our CRI Genetics Privacy Statement.
			</p>
			<p>
			    <strong>3. </strong>
			    <strong><u>The DNA Service</u></strong>
			</p>
			<p>
			    The DNA Service includes (1) us sending you a DNA Sample Kit, (2) you
			    submitting a saliva sample for DNA testing and returning the DNA Sample to
			    us as instructed, and (3) an online service where Users can create a free
			    User Account and view their results. All DNA testing performed by CRI
			    Genetics on submitted DNA Samples is done for research purposes only and
			    should not be used for individual medical or diagnostic purposes. CRI
			    Genetics will analyze Users’ genetic and genealogical information and will
			    use Users DNA Results, in the aggregate, to make discoveries in the study
			    of genealogy, anthropology, genetics, evolution, languages, cultures,
			    medicine, and other topics.
			</p>
			<p>
			    By submitting a DNA Sample for testing, you represent that you are eighteen
			    (18) years of age or older, and the DNA Sample you are submitting is your
			    own or of a person under the age of eighteen (18) for whom you are the
			    legal guardian or have obtained legal authorization to provide their DNA to
			    CRI Genetics. If you submit a DNA sample of a minor, you must provide
			    written confirmation of our authority to do so, in a format acceptable to
			    us, as requested prior to the DNA Results for the relevant minor being
			    provided. By submitting DNA samples to CRI Genetics, you give permission to
			    CRI Genetics to extract the DNA from the samples, perform genetic tests on
			    the DNA using test methods currently known and which may be developed in
			    the future, to disclose the results of the tests performed to you, to store
			    the samples for further genetic testing (with your consent) and archiving
			    purposes, and to store the results of the DNA tests in accordance with this
			    Agreement and with the CRI Genetics Privacy Statement. If you have reason
			    to believe you have an active infectious disease, condition or disorder
			    please do not return your sample to us until such time as that disease
			    condition or disorder is no longer infectious or has been cured.
			</p>
			<p>
			    CRI Genetics does not claim any ownership rights in the DNA Sample that is
			    submitted for testing. The data contained in your DNA, and any information
			    derived from it (“Genetic Information”), belongs to the person who provided
			    the DNA Sample, subject only to the rights granted to CRI Genetics in this
			    Agreement. You may request to have CRI Genetics delete your Genetic
			    Information or destroy your DNA Sample at any time by contacting
			    1-800-571-9216 and speaking to a CRI Genetics representative. If you have
			    agreed to our Consent Agreement, deletion of your Genetic Information is
			    subject to additional provisions.
			</p>
			<p>
			    By submitting your DNA Sample to CRI Genetics, you grant CRI Genetics a
			    royalty-free, worldwide, sub-licensable, transferable license to host,
			    transfer, process, analyze, distribute, and communicate your Genetic
			    Information for the purposes of providing you products and services,
			    conducting CRI Genetics’ research and product development, enhancing CRI
			    Genetics’ user experience, and making and offering personalized products
			    and services. In addition, you understand that by providing any DNA to us,
			    you acquire no rights in any research or commercial products that may be
			    developed by CRI Genetics using your Genetic Information.
			</p>
			<p>
			    CRI Genetics will only share your Genetic Information with third parties as
			    governed by the Privacy Statement. CRI Genetics does not share Genetic
			    Information with third parties without your consent, and will not share
			    your Genetic Information with law enforcement unless compelled by valid
			    legal process as described in our Privacy Statement. Any sharing of Genetic
			    Information for external research purposes is governed by the Consent
			    Agreement.
			</p>
			<p>
			    You hereby release CRI Genetics from any and all claims, liens, demands,
			    actions or suits in connection with the DNA Sample, the DNA Test or DNA
			    Results thereof, including, without limitation, errors, omissions, claims
			    for defamation, invasion of privacy, right of publicity, emotional distress
			    or economic loss.
			</p>
			<p>
			    You agree that the sample will be tested and stored in the United States as
			    provided in this Agreement. You further agree that your DNA Results may
			    only be accessible through the Website and that you may not be able to use
			    the Results in a website targeted to your country of residence or hosted
			    outside the United States.
			</p>
			<p>
			    In our sole discretion, if we believe this Agreement or any portion of it
			    has been violated, your DNA Sample may not be processed, your DNA Results
			    and DNA Sample may be deleted and your User Account may be terminated
			    without notice.
			</p>
			<p>
			    <strong>4. </strong>
			    <strong><u>Risks and Considerations</u></strong>
			    <strong><u></u></strong>
			</p>
			<p>
			    What you learn from your DNA Results may have a profound effect on your
			    life. Do not assume any information provided to you by us, whether now or
			    in the future, will be positive or appreciated. You may learn unexpected
			    information about yourself, or your family members, which could potentially
			    change your perspective on life and the world (e.g., your ancestors are not
			    from the region you knew them to be from or you are not of the ethnic
			    descent you thought you were). These conclusions could have significant
			    social, familial, legal, or economic implications. You hereby acknowledge
			    that genetic research is constantly progressing and future advances may
			    require you to obtain further services from CRI Genetics, your physician, a
			    genetic counselor, or other health care provider in order for you to
			    accurately assess the meaning of your DNA Results in the context of such
			    advances. Before you collect your sample for testing, we advise you to
			    speak with a genetic counselor or other healthcare professional with
			    special training in genetic conditions, in order to better inform yourself
			    and properly determine whether the DNA Service is right for you. Such
			    professionals may also be able to help you interpret and comprehend your
			    DNA Results and the ramifications thereof. If you feel very anxious about
			    getting genetic health results, speak with your physician or a genetic
			    counselor prior to collecting your sample for testing. If you are in any
			    way concerned about any such potential implications, DO NOT USE the DNA
			    Services. You agree to indemnify and hold CRI Genetics, its subsidiaries,
			    employees, directors, agents, licensors, managers, affiliates and any third
			    party acting on our behalf, and their respective officers, agents, partners
			    and employees, harmless from any loss, liability, claim, or demand,
			    including reasonable attorneys' fees, made due to or arising out of your
			    use of or access to the DNA Services and any implications of such use.
			</p>
			<p>
			    The laboratory may not be able to process your sample, and the laboratory
			    process may result in errors. Factors s such as, without limitation, the
			    DNA Sample not containing a sufficient volume of DNA or the DNA Sample not
			    containing enough saliva, may contribute to such failure. If the initial
			    processing fails due to laboratory failure or because the DNA Sample
			    submitted did not contain enough saliva to test, CRI Genetics will
			    reprocess the same sample at no charge to the User or will offer to send
			    another DNA Sample Kit to the User to collect a second sample at no charge.
			    If the User sends a second sample and CRI Genetics attempts to process the
			    second sample are unsuccessful, CRI Genetics will not send additional
			    sample collection kits and the User will be entitled solely and exclusively
			    to a complete refund of the amount paid to CRI Genetics, less shipping and
			    handling. Any further testing done as part of the DNA Service must be
			    purchased by the User at the standard prevailing price offered by CRI
			    Genetics at that time to all Users. CRI Genetics reserves the right to
			    refuse the DNA Service to anyone whom has repeatedly (more than once)
			    received failed testing results for any reason. If the User purchases the
			    DNA Service despite repeated failed test results, and has been advised by
			    us to not submit further DNA Samples, and resubmits another DNA Sample and
			    processing is not successful, CRI Genetics will not offer to reprocess the
			    sample or provide the User a refund. Even when testing is substantially
			    successful and meets our standards, a small, unknown fraction of the data
			    generated during the testing may not be interpretable or may be incorrect.
			    As this possibility is known in advance, Users are not entitled to refunds
			    when these events occur.
			</p>
			<p>
			    CRI Genetics does not advise you to change your conduct with respect to
			    your health based on the information contained in your DNA Results. Discuss
			    your DNA Results with your physician or other health care provider prior to
			    changing your health behaviors due to the information contained in your DNA
			    Results. The DNA Results will only contain information collected from your
			    DNA Sample and will not take into consideration any outside factors which
			    may have an impact on your health such as undiscovered genes, environmental
			    factors, or lifestyle choices. If your DNA Results indicate you are at risk
			    for a particular condition or disease, it does not mean you will
			    definitively develop the condition or disease. The converse is also true;
			    if your DNA Results indicate you are not at an elevated genetic risk for a
			    particular condition or disease, it does not mean you are guaranteed to
			    never develop such condition or disease. In either case, if you have
			    concerns or questions about the information in your DNA Results, you should
			    contact your physician or other health care provider.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Genetic research is not currently a comprehensive and completely-understood
			    field. Only a small percentage of the data we test in your DNA are known to
			    be related to human traits or health conditions. The genetic research
			    community is constantly learning more about genetics, and CRI Genetics
			    intends to contribute to this research. Additionally, some ethnic groups
			    are not included in genetic studies, so some interpretations may be
			    incomplete because our service relies, in part, on these published studies.
			    The scientific community may change its interpretation of genetics, and
			    your DNA Results, at any moment, rendering previous research as incomplete
			    or inaccurate. You hereby acknowledge the current understanding of Genetic
			    Information is rapidly evolving and our understanding of genetics could
			    change drastically at any moment.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Your Genetic Information could be used against your best interests if
			    shared with the wrong people, so be cautious when disclosing your DNA
			    Results with others. You may want to consult a lawyer to understand the
			    extent of legal protection of your genetic information before you share it
			    with anybody. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (“GINA”) was
			    enacted in the United States in 2008, with the intention of protecting
			    individuals from genetic-based discrimination by employers and health
			    insurance companies. However, the law in this sector has not been clearly
			    established and could change in the future. In addition, GINA does not
			    cover life, long-term care, or disability insurance providers. Some states
			    have laws that protect individuals with regard to their genetic
			    information. Furthermore, genetic information that you choose to share with
			    your physician or other health care provider may become part of your
			    medical record and could become accessible to other health care providers
			    and/or insurance companies in the future. As new discoveries are made, the
			    meaning of your Genetic Information could prove different in the future
			    than it does today. If you are asked by an insurance company whether you
			    have learned genetic information about health conditions and you do not
			    disclose this to them, this may be considered to be fraud.
			</p>
			<p>
			    Due to the current state of genetic knowledge and comprehension, the DNA
			    Services are for personal research, informational, and educational use
			    only. We do not provide medical advice, and you should not use the DNA
			    Services to self-diagnose a health condition or as a substitute for
			    professional medical advice. We utilize common technology used throughout
			    the research community. However, the technology utilized and the
			    discoveries we’ve made in genetics have not been clinically approved or
			    validated. In an effort to progress the genetic testing and research field,
			    CRI Genetics invites Users to participate in research conducted by CRI
			    Genetics. Participation in such research is voluntary and accessible via
			    the CRI Genetics Consent Document. Always seek the advice of your physician
			    or other health care provider with any questions you may have regarding
			    diagnosis, cure, treatment, mitigation, or prevention of any disease or
			    other medical condition or impairment or the status of your health. CRI
			    Genetics does not endorse, warrant, or guarantee the effectiveness of any
			    specific course of action, resources, tests, physician or other health care
			    providers, drugs, biologics, medical devices or other products, procedures,
			    opinions, or other information that may be mentioned on the Website. Any
			    recommendation made by us on the Website is solely intended for
			    informational purposes only and for discussion with your physician or other
			    healthcare provider. Only a trained physician or other health care provider
			    can assess your current state of health or disease, taking into account
			    many factors, including in some cases your genetics as well as your current
			    symptoms, if any. Reliance on any information provided by CRI Genetics, CRI
			    Genetics employees, others appearing on our Website at the invitation of
			    CRI Genetics, or other visitors to the Website is solely at your own risk.
			    We are not licensed as a clinical laboratory, or by any domestic or
			    international authority governing health and disease-related genetic
			    testing. We do not offer our Services in certain jurisdictions which
			    require special licenses.

			</p>
			<p>
			    i. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and CRI
			    Genetics and governs your use of the CRI Services, superseding any prior
			    agreements between you and CRI Genetics on this subject. You also may be
			    subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use
			    affiliate services, third-party content, or third-party software;
			</p>
			<p>
			    ii. Except for any disputes relating to intellectual property rights,
			    obligations, or any infringement claims, any disputes with CRI Genetics
			    arising out of or relating to the Agreement ("Disputes") shall be governed
			    by California law regardless of your country of origin or where you access
			    CRI Genetics, and notwithstanding of any conflicts of law principles and
			    the United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods. Any
			    Disputes shall be resolved by final and binding arbitration under the rules
			    and auspices of the American Arbitration Association, to be held in Los

			    reasoning issued by the arbitrator(s) at either party's request, and with
			    arbitration costs and reasonable documented attorneys' costs of both
			    parties to be borne by the party that ultimately loses. Either party may
			    obtain injunctive relief (preliminary or permanent) and orders to compel
			    arbitration or enforce arbitral awards in any court of competent
			    jurisdiction.
			</p>
			<p>
			    iii. The failure of CRI Genetics to exercise or enforce any right or
			    provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
			    provision. If any provision of this Agreement is found by a court of
			    competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that
			    the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as
			    reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of this Agreement
			    remain in full force and effect.
			</p>
			<p>
			    iv. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any
			    claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the CRI
			    Services or this Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such
			    claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.
			</p>
			<p>
			    v. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in
			    electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative
			    proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and
			    subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records
			    originally generated and maintained in printed form.
			</p>
			<p>
			    vi. The section titles in the Terms and Conditions are for convenience only
			    and have no legal or contractual effect.

			    remaining portion will remain in full force and effect.
			</p>
			<p>
			    viii. We reserve the right to modify, supplement or replace the terms of
			the Agreement, effective upon posting at    <a href="https://crigenetics.com">https://crigenetics.com</a> or notifying

			    can terminate the Agreement at any time per Paragraph 5(Termination).

			    ix. You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under the
			    Agreement. Any purported assignment and delegation shall be ineffective. We
			    may freely assign or delegate all rights and obligations under the
			    Agreement, fully or partially without notice to you. We may also
